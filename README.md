# Quiz-8
#### **Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration**
##### Inspired by Starry Night, this work deconstructs Van Gogh's painting and recreates it using digital algorithms, incorporating interactive elements. The aim is to rediscover classical art and use it for educational purposes. Moreover, the technologies contribute to the project's completion: animation design, dynamic interaction, customizable speed, and responsive sound design. Classical art serves as the artistic foundation for the project, while dynamic interaction allows users to engage with the artwork through mouse movements. Customizable speed introduces randomness to the animation, and responsive sound design ensures synchronization between the audio and the animation.
